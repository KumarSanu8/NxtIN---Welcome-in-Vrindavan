    <p class="text-dark mx-1">Vrindavan also spelt Vrindaban and Brindaban,is a historical city in the Mathura district
        of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is one of the most sacred places in Vaishnavism.It is located in the Braj Bhoomi
        region, and is where, according to Hinduism, Krishna spent most of his childhood days.The city is about 11 km
        from Mathura, Krishna's birthplace on the Agra–Delhi National Highway as NH-44.The town hosts many temples
        dedicated to the worship of Radha and Krishna.</h>

    <h5 class="text-dark mx-1">History</h5>
    <p class="text-dark mx-1">Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu culture and history, and was
        established in the 16th and
        17th centuries as a result of an explicit treaty between Muslims and Hindu Emperors,[13] and is an important
        Hindu pilgrimage site since long.

        Of the contemporary times, Vallabhacharya, aged eleven visited Vrindavan. Later on, he performed three
        pilgrimages of India, barefoot giving discourses on Bhagavad Gita at 84 places. These 84 places are known as
        Pushtimarg Baithak and since then are the places of pilgrimage. Yet, he stayed in Vrindavan for four months each
        year. Vrindavan thus heavily influenced his formation of Pushtimarg.

        The essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century, when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya
        Mahaprabhu. In the year 1515, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited Vrindavana, with the purpose of locating the lost
        holy places associated with Krishna's life.[14]

        In the last 250 years, the extensive forests of Vrindavan have been subjected to urbanisation, first by local
        Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a few
        remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species has
        been virtually eliminated. Only a few peacocks are left in the city but monkeys and cows can be seen almost
        everywhere.</p>
